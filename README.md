## Introduction

This offers a very simple class offering methods for basic data generation, ideal for unit tests or data filling.
This is not meant to be an ongoing replacement for [fzaninotto/Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), but bear in 
mind that it is[retired](https://marmelab.com/blog/2020/10/21/sunsetting-faker.html).

Note: some of these are very simple, but some items require a little code, such as filtering or formatting. This 
simply centralises this code.
